Jinx hides among some toy soldiers,
but Tom spots him and the mouse runs off,
saluting the cat like a real soldier would.

The mouse hides inside a Christmas fairy light,
causing him to glow. Not fooled, Tom grabs Jinx
and is promptly electrocuted.

Jinx then runs out of the house through the letterbox
of the front door. As Tom opens the lid of the letterbox
to see where Jinx has gone, Jinx hurls a snowball at
his face. Tom angrily barricades the slot to prevent
Jinx from getting back into the house.
